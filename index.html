                    Wikipedia:List of really, really, really stupid article ideas that you really, really, really should not create
                </h2>
                <p>An article about or described by any of the following can be safely assumed to fit into the set of unnecessary articles:
                    Creating or editing an article just to show off a picture of a cute cat or dog is always a terrible idea. Besides, there's always someone somewhere who thinks their cat is cuter.
                    You, your family, or the organization you work for.
                    Your band, which has only sold 47 copies of its one album. Even if you think it will sell 48. Or maybe 49! Or, if you get really lucky, you can pay off the record store owner so that he may buy one and your sales will have gone up to fifty!!! Keep dreamin', brotha.
                    Your imaginary friend or your imaginary friends that don't even exist.[citation needed]
                    The religion, language, or country that you made up with your friends in school one day.
                    The street you live on, unless it is on a Monopoly board. But since it is highly unlikely that you live on a Monopoly game board, we suggest that you not even try.
                    Any one of the many regions in the Pokémon video game series or lieking mudkipz, or hering dat someon lieks mudkipz. Or a random ship that includes Ash Ketchum and (insert random girl here). Remember, not everyone is a Pokémon fanatic.
                    A stunt or trick only you have ever attempted, probably unsuccessfully.
                    Any movie you made yourself which has never been seen by more people at one time than can fit in your basement. Even if you have a really big basement.
                    Individual songs that have never been released as a single nor seen radio play, unless they're twenty minutes long or have led to a phone number becoming unusable or even have questioned the essence of music itself.
                    "(Anything) in popular culture." Anything at all.
                    Likewise, "Hysterical Realism in the Works of (insert neither hysterical nor realistic author here)".
                    Your dormitory, university residence, or any suite therein.
                    Stuff nobody but that guy who changes his Spock ears more often than his underpants cares about, or the equivalent thereto. For example, a song about a custom map of a video game, unless you are famous and the song managed to release as a single.
                    Anything about which you cannot be buggered to write one complete sent
                    Subjects that cannot be studied, or the knowledge of which amounts only to the fact that it pertains to another topic. A favourite line from a movie or catchy lyric, a potent phrase used in argument, juicy facts of interest to fans, a punch-line or zinger; these are all very interesting, but usually all that can be informatively written about topic "X" is: "X is a _______ found in _______."
                    Just about everything listed on Wikipedia:Millionth topic pool.
                    For that matter, Wikipedia:Millionth topic pool.
                    Anything about your cat or dog and how cute it is (or your hamster, degu, or chinchilla).

                    For instance, these are far cuter.[citation needed]
                    Exploding Whales, or indeed Exploding Wales, or even Exploding Jimbo Wales. Or blowing up any other animals; for example, exploding mice, or even exploding Velociraptor, for that matter. Most things that implode are pretty much off the list too, with a few exceptions.
                    Anything written under the influence of recreational substances or while tired and/or emotional.
                    An article about another article, written after the use of aforementioned substances.
                    A fork of an existing article for the sole purpose of adding some humor.
                    The weather in London. Not even a redirect. (Wowee)

                    No matter how cute you are, expect no quarter in the cruel world of Wikipedia.
                    Your guild in World of Warcraft or similar time wasters. Just because you have no life a personally fascinating hobby doesn't mean you get to tell the world about it. And don't write about this guy in your guild who wiped your raid, either.
                    Something you just saw on YouTube and, possibly, laughed at.
                    Something you just put on YouTube.

                    Anything you don't know the title of.
                    Your wiki or blog. It's probably not internationally famous. If it is, well, go ahead, but let's face it; your blog of cute cats is not internationally famous (three readers is not fame).[1]
                    Your new invention or research paper that will change the world. Or why you think a certain politician will win the next election. Both of those will undoubtedly not happen.
                    Anything about your cat named Bubba or your dog named Max. No one cares. Trust us.
                    Your nomination for the Noble (or even Nobel) Peace Prize.
                    Anything about how you were abducted by aliens.
                    An article on the dream you had last night. No matter how long you describe it, it will never be interesting: Even if dreaming that you were the inventor of the chalk board who had to overcome obstacles from the evil book binding lobbyists deeply moved you to tears upon waking up.
                    An article on the person that knocked on your door while you were writing the article about your dream last night, causing you to forget about the dream (but I'll be honest, I feel for you).
                    An article about Wikpiedia, Wikipaedia, Wiokipedia, Wikipeedia, Wikipeadia, or any other Wikis that appear to be Wikipedia but aren't.
                    An article about the media response to the Wikipedia article about the barely notable thing that shouldn't even have an article (recursivity has its limits, even here).
                    The difference between Hoagy Carmichael and Stokely Carmichael.

                    Even an article on a subject that is four times cute will not survive if it is not notable.
                    An entry promoting your hilarious web series about Wikipedia.
                    Recreating this dumb list. Or this one.
                    Anything about hashtags. #IHateHashtags
                    Anything about how fat you are or how much weight you're losing (trust us; no one cares).
                    Headlight flashing – I know, it's preposterous, even for Wikipedia. But when you're done laughing and/or crying, follow the link. It really exists.
                    Assumptions about the conclusions of scientific publications that you have seen the titles of, but not read.
                    Your self-published book.

                    Your personal opinions about your (in)significant other.
                    An article on discussing the differences between you and your close friends. It does not matter to most people in the world.
                    An article about how Tyson Foods is run by a bunch of chicken fuckers because the main article is protected from vandalism by the legions of Internet trolls.[citation needed]
                    Yet another list of Google Doodles.

                    If you can't tell from the endless list of cat pictures in this article, individual cats are usually not notable enough for a Wikipedia article.
                    A new sex position that you and your boys theory-crafted one night. Including whatever 54 would mean.
                    A list of Nigerian Princes.
                    Times Scooby-Doo has defied the laws of reality.

                    Your opinion and/or fascination about outer space, even if there are lots of unusual exoplanets out there. Yes, we know. They're weird. No need to tell us that.

                    Your anus and how it had very good funny time with a girl.[citation needed]
                    The time you laughed at someone living in Fortnite (Chapter 1), even though I get that they were eaten by a black hole. Oh well, they came back!.

                    List of lists of lists of lists. The only entry there would be List of lists of lists.

                    An article about an insignificant power outage that affected your neighborhood and a few others, that left you in the dark for a while. Seriously, no one cares.
